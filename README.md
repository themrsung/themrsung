# `21-st Century Contemporary Art.`

Hey! I'm an artist. ***My code is designed to be pretty, not efficient or effective.*** The code I consider to be optimal follows $O(n!)$.

Also, I enjoy defining lambdas for trivial tasks, such as summation.

1. $f(n) = \sum^n_{i=1}{\frac{1}{2^i}}$
2. $g(m) = \lim_{m\to\infty}{f(m)}$
3. $console.log(g(1));$

Here, I use LaTeX as pseudocode to scare away the weak-minded.

***Hallowed are the Ori***
